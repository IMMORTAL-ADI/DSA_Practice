# Daily Data Structures and Algorithms Practice

Welcome to the Daily Data Structures and Algorithms Practice repository! This project is dedicated to consistent, daily improvement in problem-solving skills, focusing on core computer science concepts.

## Purpose

- Strengthen understanding of data structures and algorithms.
- Prepare for technical interviews and coding assessments.
- Track progress and maintain discipline through daily practice.

## Structure

- Each day has its own folder (e.g., `Day01`, `Day02`, ...).
- Inside each folder:
  - `problem.md`: Problem statement and description.
  - `solution.py` (or other language): Solution code.
  - `notes.md`: Reflections, alternative approaches, and learnings.

## Topics Covered

- Arrays & Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks & Queues
- Trees & Graphs
- Sorting & Searching
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Dynamic Programming
- Hashing
- Heaps & Priority Queues
- And more!

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the day's folder.
3. Read the problem, attempt your own solution, and compare with the provided one.
4. Add your notes and improvements.

## Contribution
